<h3>CSCI 321&mdash;Graphics</h3>

<h4>Programming Assignment 1: due Wednesday, January 27, 2016</h4>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you become familiar with the WebGL
graphics environment using HTML and JavaScript,
as well as to give you practice modeling 2-D objects.
Note that the sample programs are in the directory
<kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS321/handouts/CourseSamples</kbd>.</p>

<p>This assignment is worth 5 points.</p>

<p>To submit the assignment, put all the <kbd>.html</kbd> and <kbd>.js</kbd>
files your prepared for this assignment in a directory named<br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;your last name&gt;.&lt;your
given name&gt;.CS321.Assignment1</em><br>
<em>Do not</em> include the common files or the <em>Common</em> directory.
Prepare a one page description of what you have done,
including the names of the programs you want me to evaluate,
to what extent you believe they are complete, how to use them,
and brief comments on your experiences with them in text, Word or PDF format.
Put the description in the same directory.
I won't be grading the cover sheet <i>per se</i>,
but I will appreciate reasonably good writing.
Move or  copy it into the <em>/usr/people/handins/CS321 directory</em>.
Keep your project files protected in your own directories.</p>

<p>
This is an <i>individual</i> programming assignment.</p>


<ol>
<li>Using the sample program <code>object1</code> as a model,
    make <em>three</em>
    two-dimensional programs, each of which puts an object in the
    center of the canvas, using different object and background colors
    for each program.
    In each program, the object must consist of at least two triangles,
    and at least one of the objects must require three or more;
    at least one of the programs should display a non-convex object
    by breaking it into triangles. 
    Here are some suggestions:
    a cyan diamond, a magenta regular pentagon,
    a yellow chevron (v-shape) on a black background,
    a five- or six-pointed star in pink or orange.</li>

<li>Using the sample program <code>object2</code> as a model,
    make non-curved versions of the four playing-card suits
    in the four quadrants of the canvas: hearts and diamonds
    in red, clubs and spades in black.
    Try using octagons or hexagons for the three balls in the
    club symbol;
    use parts of those shapes for the curved parts of hearts
    and spades.</li>

</ol>
