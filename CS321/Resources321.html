<h4>
RESOURCES&mdash;Useful Materials</h4>

<p>
To run WebGL programs, all you need is a computing device with an OpenGL-ready
display and a web browser that is HTML 5.0 and WebGL compliant.
Personal computers running Linux (natively), MacOSX, and Windows 7.0 and higher
are generally equipped for WebGL;
personal devices running iOS will probably work, but Android devices
will probably not;
the Linux virtual machine we use on campus does not support WebGL because
it doesn't have access to the GPU.
Most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, will support WebGL;
Internet Explorer, unsurprisingly, does not, but the new Microsoft browser
in Windows 10 probably does.</p>

<p>
To develop WebGL programs, you need a text editor, preferably one that supports
HTML and JavaScript syntax.
I recommend the <i>Bluefish</i> editor for HTML files;
it also supports JavaScript files, and it's available for all the major operating
systems.
On Linux, the <i>gedit</i> editor is a good alternative;
in a pinch, you can use <i>WordPad</i> but not <i>NotePad</i> on Windows.
If you use the CS Department computers, I recommend that you do your editing in
the Linux virtual machine, but you'll need to display your programs using Chrome
on the Windows side.</p>


<h5>Guidelines for developing WebGL programs.</h5>

<p>
Here are the steps to develop and run WebGL programs:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Always start with an existing program that already loads
	    and runs.
	    Use a program that is as similar as possible to the one you
	    want to develop.
	    To avoid plagiarism, include comments to identify the
	    source you are building on,
	    as well as comments to identify yourself, your collaborators
	    (if any), and your contribution to the project.</li>
	<li>Both textbook and course sample programs assume that you
	    have the textbook <i>Common</i> folder in the parent directory
	    of the one you are developing the program in, so make your
	    own copy of that folder and put it in the directory where your
	    programs will go.
	    In general, put each program in its own directory, with that
	    directory in the same directory as the <i>Common</i> folder.<br>
	    Please do not put these programs in publicly accessible places
	    (i.e., on a public web page) until after the course is over.
	    As usual, you have a responsibility to protect your class files
	    from access by other students during this time.</li>
	<li>Copy the source page (.html) file and its associated
	    JavaScript (.js) file and rename them
	    appropriately, if necessary.</li>
	<li>To view the program, right-click on the page file icon in a
	    directory window, and choose &ldquo;Open-with&rdquo; and the
	    <i>Chrome</i> browser or another WebGL-enabled broswer.</li>
	<li>To assist with debugging, you can open the JavaScript console
	    in your browser.
	    Errors in loading and running JavaScript display there.
	    To open the console in Chrome on Windows, select
	    <code>Chrome Menu > More Tools > Developer tools</code>,
	    and then click the <em>Console</em> tab.
	    (The Chrome menu is the thingy with three bars in the upper
	    right corner.)</li>
</ol>


<h5>Textbook Resources</h5>
<p>
The source code for programs in the textbook, including several that are
not included in the printed textbook, is at
<kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS321/handouts/Angel_WebGL_7E</kbd>.
The authors have made these files publicly available to users of their book.</p>

<p>
The errata page for the textbook is
<a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SEVENTH_EDITION/errata" >here</a>.
It does not appear to be complete.</p>


<h5>Sample Programs</h5>
<p>
Sample programs prepared by the instructor are linked below.
The source code for these programs is in separate folders within
<kbd>/usr/people/classes/CS321/handouts/CourseSamples</kbd>.

<ul>
   <li><a href="handouts/CourseSamples/object1/object1.html" >Green
       Square</a></li>
   <li><a href="handouts/CourseSamples/object2/object2.html" >Blue
       Square and Green Triangle</a></li>
   <li><a href="handouts/CourseSamples/SwissFlag/SwissFlag.html" >Swiss
       Flag</a></li>
   <li><a href="handouts/CourseSamples/polygon/polygon.html" >Polygon</a>
       with a form to change the number of sides</li>
   <li><a href="handouts/CourseSamples/double_pyramid/doublePyramid.html" >A
       3D Double Pyramid</a> with a form to change the number of sides</li>
</ul>


<h5>Tutorials</h5>
<p>
There are online tutorials for everything you need for this course.
The website w3schools.com has excellent tutorials for both
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" ><em>HTML</em></a> and
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" ><em>JavaScript</em></a>.
You won't necessarily need to learn too much more HTML than the sample programs
provide, but you'll probably want some extra help with JavaScript.</p>

<p>
Between the textbook and the class, we will cover pretty much all the WebGL
you need to know for the course.
At the other end of things, the <em>WebGL Programming Guide</em> listed on
the course homepage tells you everything you could possibly want to know,
if not always in the easiest to understand format.
There are many tutorials online.
One tutorial that takes a step-by-step interactive learning approach is
<a href="http://www.webglacademy.com/" >WebGL Academy</a>.</p>
