<h2>
CSCI 321&mdash;Graphics</h2>

<h4>Final Programming Project: due Friday, April 29, 2014</h4>

<p>
The final programming project is an opportunity to put together the various
graphics programming elements that we've learned this semester.
There is no fixed assignment, but there are a number of requirements that
are discussed below.
</p>

<p>
Students who have submitted at least four of the first five assignments may
choose to be part of a group project;
those who have submitted fewer than
four of the first five assignments must do an individual project.
A group many have two or three students.
I will expect a group project to be somewhat more involved than an individual
project, but there is no firm metric on that expectation;
in particular, group projects don't have to somehow be &ldquo;twice as
good&rdquo; as individual projects.</p>

<p>
Projects should present a complete graphical environment, using appropriate
modeling, transformations, lighting and shading, and texture mapping;
if needed, the project should also include use of B&eacute;zier curves
and/or hierarchical modeling.
The project must also include animation and/or the ability to move the
viewer and/or light(s) and/or some of the objects in the scene with
user controls.</p>

<p>
Successful projects in the past have included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Modeling a well-known building on one of the campuses</li>
	<li>Modeling a chess-board with its pieces and the ability to
	    move the pieces on the board</li>
	<li>Modeling a race course with the viewer following an animation
	    around the course</li>
	<li>Modeling a person, robot, or animal walking across the ground</li>
	<li>Modeling the Solar System, with texture maps on the surfaces of
	    the planets</li>
</ul>
