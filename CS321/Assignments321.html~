<h2>CSCI 321</h2>

<H4>
ASSIGNMENTS&mdash;Graphics Programs</H4>

<p>The only way to learn computer graphics is to write graphics
programs&mdash;lots of graphics programs.
There will be six individual programming assignments
during the first three-fourths of the course.
Each assignment will be worth 5 points.
I will accept assignments up to one cycle late with a penalty of one point;
I will not accept later assignments.</p>

<p>There will be a major programming project during the last third of the
course which will be worth 25 points.
I plan to give you a lot of flexibility on that project,
including whether you do it as an individual or group project.
You will get more details later.
This project will be due in class on Friday, April 29, and there
will be no extensions.</p>
